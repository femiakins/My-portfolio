# Portfolio scaffold

This is a minimal static portfolio scaffold created to resemble the layout from the linked example. It uses Tailwind CSS via CDN so you can preview quickly by opening `index.html`.

How to preview

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Or serve it from a simple static server, for example using Python 3:

```powershell
python -m http.server 5173
```

Replace the placeholder content (name, projects, images) with your actual details.
